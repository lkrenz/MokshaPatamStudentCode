| September 1st | 2:35-3:05 | I spent the first 20 or so minutes working out a solution on a google doc then began to code. I didn't get very far, but I began to create an array that conatins all of the snakes and ladders ordered based off of their entrance position. I will then use this array to determine the path i take through the map. |
