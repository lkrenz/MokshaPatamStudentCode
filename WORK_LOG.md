| April 5       |   9-10pm    |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         I tried to write abstract, efficient code. |
| September 1st |  2:35-3:05  |                                                                                                                                                                             I spent the first 20 or so minutes working out a solution on a google doc then began to code. I didn't get very far, but I began to create an array that conatins all of the snakes and ladders ordered based off of their entrance position. I will then use this array to determine the path i take through the map. |
| September 1st | 3:10 - 3:40 |                                                                                                                                                                               I spent this time beginning to shape the loop and external methods that will find the optimal path. The optimal path will be found by a while loop that calls a recursive algorithm to determine if taking the next landmark is optimal. I began to code the recursive algorithm and completed a few helper methods. |
| September 1st | 3:52 - 4:22 |                                                                                                                                               I spent this time largely working on the takeLandmark() before I realized there was a faster solution to the problem. Instead of determining whether I should take the next landmark, I could just find the optimal path (I would have to do this anyway to determine if I should take the next landmark). I started coding this method, findPath(). |
| September 1st | 4:27 - 4:57 |                                                                                                                                                                                                                               I spent this time building out the new recursive algorithm. I finished (I haven't run it yet so probably not actually done) coding the part of the algorithm if the next landmark is a ladder and am still working on the condition if the next landmark is a snake. |
| September 1st |    5:00     |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 I finished coding the recursive method (it doesn't run but I technically finished it). I'm running into an infinite recursion bug that I will start working on in my next session. |
| September 4   | 10:00-10:30 | While I was on the right track with my past ideas, the code itself was no where near working. As such, I have decided that deleting it and restarting will be significantly faster than trying to fix the code. Also, using breadth first search is a significant enough change to necessitate a big shift. I have begun to implement breadth first search and have written a method to combine the snakes and ladders arrays into one, making the process of searching for either more efficient. |
| September 4   |  4:30-5:06  |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                While I was originally planning to write BFS recursively, I ended up switching to writing the method using a while loop. I finished the initial coding of the method and will do debugging in my next work section. |
| September 4   |   6:6:30    |                                                                            I spent all of this time debugging. I first realized that I was representing the game board starting at 0 but I forgot to shift the start points of the snakes and ladders down by one. This fix allowed both the larger and basic cases to pass their tests. Then I realized I forgot to shift the end points as well, which got my code through the tricky case. I'm still working on debugging the much larger case. |
