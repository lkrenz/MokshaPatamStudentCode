| April 5       |   9-10pm    |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           I tried to write abstract, efficient code. |
| September 1st |  2:35-3:05  |                               I spent the first 20 or so minutes working out a solution on a google doc then began to code. I didn't get very far, but I began to create an array that conatins all of the snakes and ladders ordered based off of their entrance position. I will then use this array to determine the path i take through the map. |
| September 1st | 3:10 - 3:40 |                                 I spent this time beginning to shape the loop and external methods that will find the optimal path. The optimal path will be found by a while loop that calls a recursive algorithm to determine if taking the next landmark is optimal. I began to code the recursive algorithm and completed a few helper methods. |
| September 1st | 3:52 - 4:22 | I spent this time largely working on the takeLandmark() before I realized there was a faster solution to the problem. Instead of determining whether I should take the next landmark, I could just find the optimal path (I would have to do this anyway to determine if I should take the next landmark). I started coding this method, findPath(). |
